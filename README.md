# Interactive Global Economic Health Map: Unveiling Interdependencies through Visual Analytics

**Overview:**

This project develops an interactive data visualization tool to analyze and display correlations between key global economic indicators.  The analysis aims to provide businesses with a clearer understanding of global economic interdependencies, facilitating proactive risk assessment and opportunity identification.  The tool leverages visual analytics to present complex economic data in an easily digestible and insightful manner.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


**Example Output:**

The script will produce the following output:

* **Console Output:**  The program will print a summary of the analysis performed, including key correlations identified between different economic indicators.  Specific statistical measures (e.g., correlation coefficients) will be displayed.

* **Visualization Output:**  The script will generate various plot files (e.g., `.png` images) visualizing the relationships between economic indicators. These plots will be saved in the `output` directory.  These visualizations will include interactive elements (if applicable, depending on the chosen visualization libraries and techniques) to allow exploration of the data.  Examples include interactive scatter plots showing correlations between GDP growth and inflation rates across different countries.
